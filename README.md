# MIA_Phase-1_Tasks_Repo
This is a GitHub repository of my previous tasks with MIA Robotics team from phase 1. Each task is in a different branch with the name of the task
# Task 1:
    First task contains some simple problem solving using c++
# Task 2:
    In the second task, i used proteus to design circuits that are required to solve the problem
# Task 3:
    The third task was basically a design for a fully operational minesweeper tank designed to navigate Gotham's streets, detect obstacles, locate mines, and defuse them. The tank is also capable of localizing its position within the city's grid to ensure thorough coverage.
# Task 4:
    In this task i worked with python and Jupyter Notebook to load dataset as datrframe and do some operations on them using libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.pyplot
# Task 5:
    I completed task 5 by implementing a communication system where:
    ●  A master Arduino acts as the central control unit.
    ● A slave Arduino is connected to the master using I2C.
    ● The second slave Arduino is connected to the master using serial communication.
    ● One slave sends a message to the other relaying through the master without any direct connection between the two slaves.

    Also there is another problem where i had to convert a signal from analog to digital using ADC with four cases.
    Each case has either a bit encoder with different number of bits or has a different sampling time or both
